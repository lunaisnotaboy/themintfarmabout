Hi everyone. This post is meant to be seen by my friends and family.

As this is the case, most of this will be personal. You **do not** have to read this. You won't be missing much.

So... where to start? I guess a good place would be saying this right out of the gate:

**I am transgender.**

Mom already knows, but she does not know the full story. None of you do.

So before you take out your pitchforks, please, for the love of God, read this entire thing.

## The Start of This Entire Thing

This entire thing has been happening over the span of around three years (circa. late-2017/early-2018). That was when I was first introduced to a community of websites called **Miiverse Clones** (or MVC for short). To make a *very* long story short, they were attempts at a revival of Nintendo's now-defunct Miiverse.

I hosted a good portion of them. I am not proud of it, but it is what it is.

They all started great. It was only after a few people started "raiding" (basically spamming the website with NSFW content) that things got worse.

I attempted to leave the community three times. Twice, I was roped back in by a (now former, thank god) friend named DaKux. He is a French 13-year-old that did not have the expertise to make the websites functional, however, I did.

Both times I agreed, but only because he also agreed not to make me join the site.

Needless to say, I was eventually forced to so I could keep content off my Cloudinary (an image hosting provider) account.

The third time I left, I left for good.

He had been deleting various projects on the server that I needed to back up without my permission, and I was fed up with it.

At first, he claimed it was an accident. I believed him. Eventually, they became too common to be an accident.

I confronted him, and told him I was leaving for good. He understood.

And that was the end of it.

## My Friends

The only part of MVC I am grateful for is that they introduced me to my friends. They helped me out in the darkest parts of this journey, and I am forever grateful to them. Whenever you heard me talk about experiences with my friends, I was likely referring to them.
