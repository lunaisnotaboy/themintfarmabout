Hi everyone. This post is meant to be seen by my friends and family.

As this is the case, most of this will be personal. You **do not** have to read this. You won't be missing much.

So... where to start? I guess a good place would be saying this right out of the gate:

**I am transgender.**

Mom already knows, but she does not know the full story. None of you do.

So before you take out your pitchforks, please, for the love of God, read this entire thing.

## The Start of This Entire Thing

This entire thing has been happening over the span of around three years (circa. late-2017/early-2018). That was when I was first introduced to a community of websites called **Miiverse Clones** (or MVC for short). To make a *very* long story short, they were attempts at a revival of Nintendo's now-defunct Miiverse.

I hosted a good portion of them. I am not proud of it, but it is what it is.

They all started great. It was only after a few people started "raiding" (basically spamming the website with NSFW content) that things got worse.

I attempted to leave the community three times. Twice, I was roped back in by a (now former, thank god) friend named DaKux. He is a French 13-year-old that did not have the expertise to make the websites functional, however, I did.

Both times I agreed, but only because he also agreed not to make me join the site.

Needless to say, I was eventually forced to so I could keep content off my Cloudinary (an image hosting provider) account.

The third time I left, I left for good.

He had been deleting various projects on the server that I needed to back up without my permission, and I was fed up with it.

At first, he claimed it was an accident. I believed him. Eventually, they became too common to be an accident.

I confronted him and told him I was leaving for good. He understood.

And that was the end of it. I cut off my connections with him, and we went our separate ways.

## My Friends

The only part of MVC I am grateful for is that they introduced me to my friends. They helped me out in the darkest parts of this journey, and I am forever grateful to them. Whenever you heard me talk about experiences with my friends, I was likely referring to them.

## Regarding the Elephant in the Room

You are probably thinking, "Well, you just confessed to something that will sever your connection to the internet for the rest of your childhood, but what does this have to do with being transgender?"

I really did not want to type this in the first place, because I *knew* that if I told you that I had been connecting with people (who you would classify as "strangers," but they really aren't, no matter how much you tell me otherwise), that you would forcefully sever my connection with the only people keeping me sane.

I knew that. I really did.

Throughout the entirety of this MVC fiasco, I began questioning my gender. At first, I thought it was just a phase, something I was brainwashing myself to think, something to blame my depression on. I still subconsciously think that.

Eventually, I worked up the courage to talk to my good friend [mint](https://they.mint.lgbt) (one of the friends I mentioned earlier) and told him what was going on in my head.

We eventually worked out that I was, in fact, feeling gender dysphoria.

However, I couldn't work up the courage to talk to my parents. Mom found out from guessing and we talked in her car while driving out in the countryside, so that's how she knows.

Dad was and still is, too terrifying to approach. So many times he asked, "Where did my little boy go?" and it filled me with *so much* guilt.

I wanted to say, "Dad, he's still here, he's just a girl now," but I couldn't. I didn't know how he would react. Would he disown me? Would he kick me out? Or would he accept it and help me transition?

So for the past three years, I have been going by the name Luna. Every time I see my avatar on Discord or [Matrix](https://matrix.org), I am filled with so much euphoria, thinking that one day, I may be able to be recognized for a girl without telling anyone explicitly.

## Where Have I Been on the Internet?

Because I know you'll probably take everything away from me for the rest of my childhood, I'll make it simple for you.

* I co-founded and help run an organization called [mint.lgbt](https://mint.lgbt) with mint and jo!
* I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lunaisnotaboy) account
* I run a website called The Mint Farm with several different sections, all on the laptop at home ([Mastodon](https://themintfarm.ml), [Gitea](https://devel.themintfarm.ml), [Bitbucket](https://git.themintfarm.ml), [Jira](https://jira.themintfarm.ml), [Matrix](https://element.themintfarm.ml))
* I have several code repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/lunaisnotaboy)
* I have a [Keybase](https://keybase.io/lunaisnotaboy) to help manage PGP keys
* A [Discord](https://discord.com) account
* And probably more that I'm forgetting

Just please, if you are going to take everything away, let me say goodbye to them one last time.

You have no idea what they mean to me.
